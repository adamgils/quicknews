# QuickNews - Article Summarizer
Live version of this app at [quicknews.streamlit.app](https://quicknews.streamlit.app/)

## Description
This app, QuickNews, generates a summary of articles and news reports using OpenAI's GPT-3 based [Davinci model](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/overview) for text generation. QuickTube accepts the URL of an article as input and uses the GPT-3 Davinci model to generate a summary of the content.

## Contribution
I hope this will be of value to people seeking to quickly get a summary of articles without having to read the entire thing. Plus, this app can serve as a useful example of using GPT-3 for natural language processing tasks such as summarization.
